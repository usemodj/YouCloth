Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.


1. 레일즈 프로젝트 생성
 	rails new YouCloth  -d=mysql
 	
2. devise 설치
a) Gemfile 에 devise 추가

#Authenticate
gem 'devise', '>= 2.0.4'

b) bundle install 실행 
 YouCloth> bundle install
 devise 를 최신버전으로 업데이트 하려면: gem update devise
 
c) generator 실행 
YouCloth> rails generate devise:install
      create  config/initializers/devise.rb
      create  config/locales/devise.en.yml
===============================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here 
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment 
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root :to => "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. If you are deploying Rails 3.1 on Heroku, you may want to set:

       config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

     On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
     or load models when precompiling your assets.

===============================================================================

d)  add Devise to any of your models using the generator:  rails generate devise MODEL
 Replace MODEL by the class name used for the applications users, it's frequently 'User' but could also be 'Admin'. 
 This will create a model (if one does not exist) and configure it with default Devise modules. 
 Next, you'll usually run "rake db:migrate" as the generator will have created a migration file (if your ORM supports them). 
 This generator also configures your config/routes.rb file to point to Devise controller.
 
 YouCloth> rails generate devise User
 
 e) copy all views to your application:

  YouCloth> rails generate devise:views
  
 3. display the results of the 'index' action (method) in the 'home' controller.
 
  $ rails generate controller home index 
  
4. config/environments/development.rb

# In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }
  config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {:enable_starttls_auto => false}
