== Rails 3 on Ubuntu 10.10 with RVM, Passenger and Nginx

ref. http://thekindofme.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/rails-3-on-ubuntu-10-10-with-rvm-passenger-and-nginx/

This covers setting up a Ubuntu 10.10 box to run rails 3 on production. Please notice it only focus on installing and setting up things mentioned in the title. However there are other things that you should configure and setup when deploying a application to production (like ntpd for example).

== Installing RVM

We will need git before we can get started.
1
sudo apt-get install git

Install rvm according to the official guide.
1
bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )

add
1
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.

to your .bashrc.

Once you edit your bashrc file execute the following to load rvm without logging out and back in
1
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

Just to be safe check wether "rvm is a function", which is what it should be.
1
type rvm | head -n1


== Install ruby 1.9.2

See what you get out of rvm notes. you will need to install some stuff before you can compile ruby.
1
aptitude install build-essential bison openssl libreadline5 libreadline5-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libmysqlclient-dev
The above packages covers some common stuff. It should be enough to get you started. However depending on what gems you want to install you might need to install additional dependencies.

rvm install 1.9.2

Set 1.9.2 as the default

rvm use 1.9.2 --default

== Passenger

Install passenger as instructed in rvm documentation http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/integration/passenger/
1
rvm 1.9.2 --passenger
2
rvm 1.9.2
3
gem install passenger
4
rvmsudo passenger-install-nginx-module

Let passenger downland and install nginx for you.
Modify /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf (thats the default location).
‘For Nginx users, replace the passenger_ruby line with:’
1
passenger_ruby /home/wayne/.rvm/bin/passenger_ruby;

Add a block like this to host your RoR site

server {

      listen 80; #the server will be running on this port

      server_name www.yourhost.com;

      root /home/deployer/your_rails_project/public;   # <--- be sure to point to 'public'!

      passenger_enabled on;

   }

== Nginx init script

From: http://github.com/jnstq/rails-nginx-passenger-ubuntu

cd
git clone git://github.com/jnstq/rails-nginx-passenger-ubuntu.git
sudo cp rails-nginx-passenger-ubuntu/nginx/nginx /etc/init.d/nginx
sudo chown root:root /etc/init.d/nginx

More information on http://wiki.nginx.org/Nginx-init-ubuntu


== MySQL

aptitude search mysql
# sudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server
sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.5  mysql-client-5.5

Get the source for your rails app. unzip it in your home folder (or where ever you want to. But be sure to edit the nginx config as appropriate).

cd to-your-rails-app-folder
bundle install
rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=production
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart

Thats it!
