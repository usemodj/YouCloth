Add to Gemfile
gem 'wikitext'

=== Rails support
The Wikitext extension provides a template handler so that templates named following the template_name.html.wikitext format will automatically be translated from wikitext markup into HTML when rendered.

Likewise, a to_wikitext method (aliased as w) is added to the String class (and also NilClass, for convenience) so that content can be easily translated from inside view templates following patterns like:

@post.body.w
